  attribute types, and into all container types
  (Collection, List, Set, Map)

  duplicate entries, and it keeps the ordering
  intact when saving and selecting.
- Added primitive type handling in query statement for
  lists and object type attributes
- Java 5 template classes (aka. generics) now work.
- Fixed mysql boolean type handling

2.3.0.1
~~~~~~~
- Fixed hashCode() and equals() dependency.

2.3.0
~~~~~
- Dynamic object capability added. It is possible now to
  define classes dynamically (runtime), and also define the
  set of attributes to an object dynamically.
- Extended polymorphism (attributes can be any class or
  interface, and query statement can be any class or interface too)
- Fixed: maximal connection count now only indicator, not limit
- Added LockTracker.
- Modified save logic: now save is not incremental, but saves all
  changed attributes compared to the current state of the object.
- Replaced OnDemandList and OnDemandMap with "lazy" counterparts.
  This means, member List, Map, and Sets (or any Collection) can have
  unlimited number of entries. At any given time, there are only a handful
  objects loaded, but the containers still are fully functional. Paging,
  and loading is handled transparently.
- Implemented smart-lazylist. If there would be many statements to execute,
  then a pre-select is execute to determine which tables/statements will
  yield non-empty results.
- Implemented local optimization into lazy list. If there would be many
  left table terms, it pre-selects which will be used.
- Improved node status detection (avoid "not ready for service", when possible)
- Fixed: node does not need a preferred network address, all addresses are used
- Fixed: node works now without a non-local network interface
- Fixed: reserved table names were not translated
- Renamed project to BeanKeeper!

2.2.0
~~~~~
- Changed save policy. Only differences/changes are saved.
- Multiple Store (scalability) support!
- Fixed: Changes were not detected when an attribute was set to null,
  but no previous changes were recorded in the Store for that object.

2.1.0
~~~~~
- Added HSQLDB support.
- Added documentation.
- Updated apidoc.
- Fixed: excluded inner and anonymous classes from handling.
- Fixed: transaction listening and recursion avoidance
- Fixed: historical queries stayed in cache

2.0.1
~~~~~
- Separated runtime and compile dependencies
- Fixed List and Map modification error.

2.0.0
~~~~~
- Optimized count statements. Now they're run once (max) on every lazy list.
- Optimized selecting referred objects.
- Fixed: exception is thrown if a name conflict is detected in a query
- Added transaction statistics.
- Added search result cache.
- Fixed: library throws exception if it sees an object which has no default 
  constructor.

1.4.0
~~~~~
- Added index handling. Currently all fields will be indexed.
- Added findSingle() methods, for selecting single objects.
- Added table view selects.

1.3.5
~~~~~
- Fixed: historical select now works with arbitrary resolution,
  so selects with no date specified will return a lazy list
  with exactly the database contents currently available.
- Fixed: transactions are now truly atomic. It is not possible
  to query an inconsistent state.
- Fixed: objects are now locked during transactions, concurrent
  modification will throw exception.

1.3.4
~~~~~
- Added historical search capability. A query can be run in the past
  returning exactly the result it would have returned on given date.
- On-demand lists and maps now stay unchanged even if there are
  updates running during iterating over them.
- Object member lists and maps now handle null values correctly,
  that is: null values in lists are disallowed, maps handle null values.
- Removed Derby support (it does not have necessary features)
- Fixed: null parameters are now handled correctly

1.3.3
~~~~~

- Added persistenceId support. When naming an attribute persistenceId (long),
  it's value will be always set with the object's unique id inside
  the library.
- Added Apache Derby support
- Database reserved words now can be used as attributes, the library
  will escape them

1.3.2
~~~~~

- Added 'ilike' operator
- Added special keyword 'now' to the query language, which can be used
  to compare with dates, and represents the current time/date.
- Fixed: List and Maps did not stay null
- Fixed: classes of same name but different packages were mapped to same
  table
- Fixed: operators <= and >= where left out of syntax, now added.
- Fixed: polymorphic queries for attributes in superclass did not work

1.3.1
~~~~~

- Fixed: orderby syntax was not like the other terms
- Fixed: now one can order by attributes not in the selected class
- Added byte array support

1.3.0
~~~~~

- Added polymorphism support
